## Getting Started

To view this live on your browser, go to https://sjconst.github.io/get-giphy

## Technical Approach

This small project uses asynchronous ajax requests to fetch gifs of female leaders from giphy. Buttons are created dynamically in JavaScript. Users can also create additional buttons and get gifs to those. Using local storage, users can save favorites in the sidebar.
